## 📌 Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. Create a **new branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit clearly:
   (Don't change version numbers, they are managed by the release process)
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to the `develop` branch:
   > ❗ **Do NOT open PRs against the `main` branch**.
