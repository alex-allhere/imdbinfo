# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Community involvement is welcome and encouraged.  
These guidelines exist to ensure contributions are **meaningful, fair, and aligned with the project’s needs**.  
They follow the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue First
- **All pull requests must be tied to a previously discussed issue.**
- Please open an issue to propose a bug fix, feature, or refactor before writing code.
- In the issue, describe the motivation, potential solutions, and scope.
- Wait for feedback from maintainers before working on a PR.

This ensures efforts are not duplicated, and contributions are aligned with the project’s direction.

---

### 2. Issues Labeled for Contribution
- Issues marked with the **`help wanted`** label are open for contributions.
- If you’d like to take one, please comment on the issue to avoid duplication.
- PRs should reference the issue they resolve (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Issues marked as **`good first issue`** are intended for newcomers and typically require less context.

---

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests
- PRs **must reference the issue** they address.
- PRs without an associated issue or prior discussion may be closed.
- Substantive contributions are prioritized — e.g., new features, bug fixes, documentation, or meaningful improvements to maintainability.
- **Purely mechanical or trivial changes** (e.g., automated search/replace, formatting-only changes, or style changes with no functional impact) should be proposed in an issue first.  
  Maintainers may address these directly rather than merging a PR.
- **Excluded from PRs:** please do **not** submit PRs that change:
  - Version bumping / release tags  
  - GitHub workflows / CI configuration  
  - Code of Conduct  
  - Legal disclaimers / license text  
  - Repository core files (project settings, funding config, security policy, etc.)  
  These are maintainer responsibilities.

---

### 4. Code Style & Standards
- Follow project coding style and conventions.
- Include tests and/or documentation where applicable.
- Ensure PRs target the correct branch (not `master` directly, unless specified).

---

### 5. Communication & Conduct
- Discussions should remain respectful and constructive.
- Feedback on PRs or issues is **not personal**; it’s about what best serves the project.
- See our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

---

## Why These Rules Exist
- They help keep contributions meaningful and fair across contributors.
- They prevent wasted effort on code that may not fit the project’s goals.
- They are fully in line with GitHub’s recommendations for [healthy contribution practices](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

By following these steps, you help ensure your contribution can be reviewed, discussed, and merged smoothly.
